visualization by ggplot2

## Datasets
[Fish data](https://github.com/Trouble404/R-and-ggplot2-application-data-processing/blob/master/fish.txt)

## Method
*    Sort data based on ascending order of
time and plot the distribution and linear
fitting diagram.
*    Separate data to 24 independent group
hour by hour.
*    Calculate the mean, standard deviation
and confidence interval of separated data.
*    Plot the line chart between two variables
based on processed data.
*    Plotting based on the [ggplot2](https://www.sohu.com/a/113228265_470062) library.

## Result
* Distribution of catching time

## Anlysis
**Figure 4 gives the average fish caught hour by hour, it could find time between 5:00 and 6:00 has higher average number 2.37 and highest lower band of fish weight., Therefore the estimated best time to go fishing is 5:00~6:00.**
